AkkaTracker is a Scala and Akka actors based program that processes .wav audio files.  It is working towards automatic detection and counting of animal vocalizations from field recordings, but for the moment merely does some messing about with .wav audio.  Currently it can create sine tones and also approximate a square wave tone with some hand rolled fourier synthesis.  It may also be helpful as a bare bones Akka example, with a primitive but useful command reader.
