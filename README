AkkaTracker is a Scala and Akka actors based program that processes .wav audio files.
It is working towards automatic detection and counting of animal vocalizations from field recordings,
but for the moment merely messes about with .wav audio.  It can create sine tones and also approximate a square
wave tone with some simple Fourier synthesis.  It may also be helpful as a bare bones Akka example,
with a primitive but useful command reader.
